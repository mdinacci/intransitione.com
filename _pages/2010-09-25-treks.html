A summary of the best treks I've done in South America, useful to me in order not to forget them, maybe useful to you to plan your next one.

<h2><a name="arg">Argentina</a></h2>
<strong>El Chalten</strong>
<a href="http://www.intransitione.com/blog/patagonia-2/img_0774/" rel="attachment wp-att-387"><img src="http://www.intransitione.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_0774-300x200.jpg" alt="" title="Parque Nacional El Chalten" width="300" height="200" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-387" /></a>
One day or multi day spectacular hikes, in high season is even possible to trek across the Viedma glaciar, ending the walk at the Viedma lake !
High mountain kind of landscape, cold, at the end of the season the vegetation is an explosion of colours. Possibility to climb the Fitz Roy (good luck) and other peaks.
Trekking is free in most of the park but after the refugio (can't remember the name) is private property and trekkers need to get the permission and pay there. The town is small and expensive, there are a couple of camp sites, one very good close to the end of the village and on the opposite road of the ridicolously overpriced YHA hostel.
Highly recommended.

<strong>Ushuaia</strong>
<a href="http://www.intransitione.com/blog/tierra-del-fuego/img_0390/" rel="attachment wp-att-351"><img src="http://www.intransitione.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_0390-300x200.jpg" alt="" title="Parque Nacional Tierra del Fuego" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-351" /></a>

The National Park in Ushuaia is more about lagoons and low mountains. Beautiful but not as stunning as El Chalten. 
It is possible to camp in the park for few days, entrance is expensive, transport to the park in a minivan from the big square close to the harbour or hitchiking.
If you have a limited time and want to trek, head straight to El Chalten or to Torres del Paine instead of coming here.

<strong>Bariloche</strong>
There are many possibilities to trek.
<a href="http://www.intransitione.com/blog/the-last-bits-of-patagonia/img_0931/" rel="attachment wp-att-405"><img src="http://www.intransitione.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_0931-300x200.jpg" alt="" title="Trekking in Bariloche" width="300" height="200" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-405" /></a> 
Unfortunately most only in high season, after there is no transport, to the base of mountains and the most interesting are far from the city. Easy one or multiple days trek are on Cerro Campanario. 

Bariloche is a big city, good outdoor equipment shops in town and FANTASTIC ice cream.

<strong>Iruya</strong>
<a href="http://www.intransitione.com/blog/argentina-theres-more-than-patagonia-part-ii/img_1826/" rel="attachment wp-att-550"><img src="http://www.intransitione.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/IMG_1826-300x200.jpg" alt="On the way to San Isidro, from Uruya" title="On the way to San Isidro, from Uruya" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-550" /></a>
A small village in the north of Argentina three hours from Humahuaca on a scary bus.
Trek to San Isidro is the most frequently done but there are other possibilities, ask the locals. The walk in the opposite direction of San Isidro is actually much prettier but according to the locals it leads to a village very far from Iruya; I'm not sure about it as in the morning we saw kids walking from that direction. Probably they don't want to be bothered by tourists so it's better to leave them alone. The river has to be crossed many times, especially in the opposite direction of San Isidro, off season it may be very dangerous as the flow will be very strong. The mountains are beautifully colored, it's even prettier than in Purmamarca.

<h2><a name="bol">Bolivia</a></h2>
<strong>El Choro</strong>
[singlepic id=147 w=320 h=240 float=left]
Starts at 5000mt, finish at 2000. Most of the path is along an Inca trail, still well conserved. Three days normally, camping is not free but cheap and good almost in every spot. There are reports of lonely trekkers being assaulted by locals. There's a tax of 10 bolivianos to pay in one of the villages you get through. Transport is cheap from La Paz taking a bus to <i>La Cumbre</i>. The return is normally with a public bus from Zongo. Path is easy except at the beginning where there's a steep ascent (be sure not to go left ! GO RIGHT !) and the second days where there are two short ascents.
Recommended.

<strong>Huayna Potosi</strong>
[singlepic id=135 w=320 h=240 float=right border=1]
I consider it as a trek, although tourism agencies sell it as a climb. The climb is only at the end and can be done with only one ice axe. Boots and crampons are necessary from campo alto to the top. 
Normal time for ascent is 5 to 8 hours, can actually be done in less than 3 hours but be sure to leave late from the high campsite to avoid arriving too early at the top (6088mt). Generally easy, few crevasses, the top is steep and very narrow. A guide costs about 50 $US per day, there's a website (can't remember the address) with contacts and pictures of all the official guide.

Highly recommended.

<strong>Nevado Condoriri</strong>
[singlepic id=139 w=320 h=240 float=left]
Beautiful mountains and glaciers everywhere you look. Several passes at over 5000mt, several routes too, over Pico Austria or Cerro Jallaco.
Start is at the tiny village of Tuni, at 4400mt, where you can rent animals and guides. For more than 3 days it's probably better having an animal. There's a shop in La Paz (the one that sells Lonely Planet books) in calle Llampu that sells detailed maps, you'll need one if you go alone. There are many animals, collect water from the higher streams.
Recommended.
 
<strong>Sucre</strong>
This was an organized trek with Condor Trekkers volunteer-run agency as it's cheap and they use the money for projects involving the local community. 
<a href="http://www.intransitione.com/blog/teach-yourself-bolivia-in-5-minutes/img_2189/" rel="attachment wp-att-613"><img src="http://www.intransitione.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/IMG_2189-300x200.jpg" alt="Just out of Sucre, while trekking over an Inca trail" title="Just out of Sucre, while trekking over an Inca trail" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-613" /></a>
It is possible anyway to follow the Inca trail independently. Transport is the hardest part, a minivan to a point where truck leaves once a day. Return through another truck, again once a day, around 12.00 if I recall correctly.
The landscape is ok, the inca trail too but not the best maintained I've seen. Very interesting to pass through the villages and talk with the locals, which unfortunately barely speak spanish so a quechua speaking guide is required. Be careful with the water, the biggest river, can't remember the name, is heavily polluted as a result of the Potosi mines.

<h2><a name="bra">Brazil</a></h2>
<strong>Valle do Pati</strong>
<a href="http://www.intransitione.com/blog/travel-log-brazil-part-ii/img_9230/" rel="attachment wp-att-253"><img src="http://www.intransitione.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_9230-300x200.jpg" alt="" title="Chapada Diamantina" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-253" /></a>
Beautiful trek in this huge national park which is as big as Holland. Most of the trek is in the valley but there are a couple of ascents and descents, lots of rivers, caves and a tropical microclimate that makes you feel in the jungle. Starting point is Lencois, if you can contact the guide directly it'll be cheaper. My guide was fantastic, his name's Waldemar, unfortunately I lost his contacts but everybody in town knows him, try asking in the trekking shop in the main square.

<h2><a name="chi">Chile</a></h2>
<strong>Torres del Paine</strong>
<a href="http://www.intransitione.com/blog/patagonia-2/img_0637/" rel="attachment wp-att-385"><img src="http://www.intransitione.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_0637-300x200.jpg" alt="" title="Parque Nacional Torres del Paine" width="300" height="200" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-385" /></a>
One of the most beautiful places on Earth. There are many trekking possibilities, although most of the tourists do the W circuit. Don't be like the others, do the whole circuit ! It takes a couple of days more but it's well worth it, as you also walk the whole W circuit. It can be done in 5 days, though that means walking about 30km per day except the first one. The W can be done even without tent as there are refugios with restaurant and beds. Three campsites, one only on the full circuit, sell food. Camping sites are almost everywhere in good conditions, avoid <i>Campamento de los Italianos</i>, it's full of rats, unfortunately the other has occasional problems too so don't bring your best tent and always store your food outside (and out of your pockets !); that's also valid for any kind of cream and toothpaste you may have. Entrance is a bit expensive, I can't remember the price though, the starting point is Punta Arenas where you can find trekking gear if you need and cheap accomodation. The landscape is sublime, glaciers, mountains, lakes, it's absolutely stunning. It's quite easy if you don't walk too much per day, the most difficult point is the pass on the full circuit that leads to the glacier.
Highly recommended.

<strong>Volcan Puyehue</strong>
<a href="http://www.intransitione.com/blog/the-last-bits-of-patagonia/img_0946/" rel="attachment wp-att-407"><img src="http://www.intransitione.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_0946-300x200.jpg" alt="" title="El Caulle" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-407" /></a>
I didn't finish this one because of the horrible weather conditions. The ascent to the volcano required crampons and I decided to withdraw only few tens of meters from the top because of a white-out condition that was approaching. Supposedly further along on the trek there are thermal baths and geysers, the ascent the first day is pretty steep, the trail is well marked, you need to register at the restaurant before leaving, they keep your extra bags. Nice landscape and there's a free refugio where you can sleep the first night.
 
<h2><a name="per">Peru</a></h2>

<strong>Santa Cruz</strong>
[singlepic id=188 w=320 h=240 float=left]
A very common trek, it's impossible to get lost following the normal route as the trail is large and there are even signs ! 

There are stunning view of the Alpamayo, some climbers say the most beautiful mountain in the world (I heard the same story for the Fitz Roy, I guess for the Cervino too), Pisco, Huascaran, Huandoy, Chopicalqui and many more. Huascaran is just unbelievable, you have to see it to believe how massive is this mountain. The view of these mountains at some points is incredible, the Llanganuco lakes are also very nice (but if you do the normal route you're just going to see them with the bus).

The trail can be done clockwise, which is harder, or anticlockwise, which is much easier. It can be done in three days from Vaqueria to Cashapampa and viceversa too if you walk well, additional days are required if you want to go down to Yungay or up to Yanama or take other less explored routes. The entrance to the park is 65 soles, about 21 US dollars.  If I had to do it again I would go straight to Yungay from Huaraz and start from there; this way is much harder, unless you take a bus from Llanganuco to Vaqueria; another option is to take a path that goes to laguna 69 and then through the mountains and right to Vaqueria; this path is not in the official map but it exists, ask a guide! 
In shorts, dead easy but nice if you follow the normal route, many possibilities to have fun following less known routes, but bring food for at least 5 nights !

Highly recommended.

<strong>Colca Canyon</strong>
[singlepic id=193 w=320 h=240 float=right]
Normally when I want to trek somewhere I go to agencies to ask for informations and try to obtain a map. When I entered the first agency in Arequipa, they told me they go to the canyon but they don't walk, they just do the tour with a car. The second agency walks tourists for two hours !  Useless to say that if you really want to experience the canyon and meet the people living there you have to avoid these kind of agencies.

I walked two days but the normal route is three days, going very slow. The route starts at Cabanaconde, the trail, dead easy, pass through San Juan de Chuccho, Cosñirhua, Malata, the Oasis and back to Cabanaconde. 
Since I thought it was such a shane to miss the waterfall in Huaruro and the thermal baths in Llahuar, I decided for another tour. 
The first long day, I went from Cabanaconde to Huaruro, passing from the Oasis and almost touching Malata, as I went the wrong way. Once you go up the valley from the Oasis, there's a small path going left, that's the one you have to take to go Huaruro, Llahuar and others. In Paclla there's nothing so you either have a very short day or a very long one. I opted for the long, slept and eaten in the garden of a local family and went to the waterfall in the morning. 
Second day I thought to stop in Llahuar but I arrived there at 12.00 so I thought to go back to Cabanaconde. After the bridge with the geyser I got lost, there SHOULD be a trail to the left but I couldn't find it so I took the large road to the right. Unfortunately it's at least 20km to Cabanaconde following that road, and there is no water. My GPS was broken and on the map there were no cardinal points so I couldn't even use a compass...Eventually I climbed high enough to see Malata on the other side, Cabanaconde is in front so I cut through the fields and managed to go back. 

It's a nice trek, and although getting lost without water under the boiling sun wasn't pleasant, I enjoyed that hard day. There are lots of condors (best seen at the mirador <i>Cruz del Condor</i> where all tourists stop), geysers, nice hills and few waterfalls. You can sleep and eat in many of the villages so there's no need to bring all your equipment and food, although I did, except for the food for dinner.

My suggestion is to pass from San Juan de Chuccho, go to Tapay for the ruins and go to sleep in Malata the first day. Second day, go to Huaruro, leave the bags, go to the waterfall and come back to sleep in Huaruro. Third day, either leave early, go to Llahuar for the thermal baths and go back to Cabanaconde or leave late, go to Llahuar and stay there for the night. The day after back to Cabanaconde, you better leave early as the buses back to Arequipa are in the morning.
