Careers Crawler

Scrape the contents of careers.stackoverflow.com and make pretty graphs using the Google Visualization API.
Just run script.rb, it will generate json files ready to be fed to the google visualization api. 
It requires nokogiri.

See html for examples.

Totally in alpha stage, the pie graph doesn't work yet and the most interesting viz are yet to come.

Did this in a couple of days to learn Ruby (and maybe to find a job?). Ruby is fun indeed.
