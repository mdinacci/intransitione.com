<a href="/software/#synkie" alt="Synkie description and download">Synkie</a> is a tool I've written essentially to synchronise files on my computer and my phone. 

I was unhappy with most of the existing synchronisation utilities as they don't allow to include or exclude single files from a chosen directory. 

<tt>Synkie</tt> uses a source directory and a destination directory. From the GUI the user has control over every file in the source directory.
