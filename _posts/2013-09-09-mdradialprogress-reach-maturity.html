<p>Last time I've written about my <a href="">MDRadialProgress</a> control was when I had just released the very first 0.1 version. After several versions, a few bug fixes and new features, I'm finally releasing a new version that contains all features I wanted to implement for a 1.0 release. With MDRadialProgress now you can:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>* Draw progress in separated slices or as a single arc</li>
<li>* Can customize all colors, the distance of the slices and their thickness</li> 
<li>* Clockwise and anti-clockwise drawing order</li>
<li>* Can start progress from any slice, not necessarily from the top</li>
<li>* Display a label with the current progress</li> The label size automatically adapts to the space available</li>
<li>* Themes support for easier customization of multiple views</li>
<li>* Fully accessible</li>
<li>* Support iOS 6.0+</li>
<li>* Original BSD and Commercial Non-Attribution licenses available (you can use it in commercial software)</li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest change is probably the license. I realized in the last years that maintaining Open Source software is very consuming and I don't have the time to keep adding features and fixing bugs for free. Although I'm not still entirely sure about this, I decided to switch the license for MDRadialProgressView from MIT to old BSD.</p>

<p>The old BSD license, or 4-clause BSD, contains an attribution clause that has since been removed from the "New" BSD license, that forces the people using the licensed software to provide attribution to the original owner in any advertising material mentioning features or use of the licensed software. <br/>
I'm not entirely happy to have included such clause, but I couldn't find a better, existing license to allow me to distribute my software free and at the same time monetize it by forcing attribution on people and companies that don't want to provide it. That said, I'm happy to re-discuss licensing agreement with anybody interested.

<p>MDRadialProgressView is on sale on my <a href="http://sites.fastspring.com/intransitione/product/mdradialprogresslicenses">online license store</a> and you can buy a single or an unlimited license. </p>

<p>I'll follow soon with a post containing more technical documentation.</p>
