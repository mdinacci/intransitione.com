It's been ages I haven't written some Javascript code.

I always found coding in Javascript <em>excruciatingly</em> painful and the idea of getting myself again into this nightmare wasn't particularly exciting.

This was at a time when there were no such things like jQuery, Mootools or Prototype. Nobody was using the words <em>"Javascript"</em> and <em>"framework"</em> in the same sentence. 

But today, things are <b>very</b> different. I must say this was the first time in my life I actually found coding in Javascript fun.

The result of my latest two days Javascript (and PHP) coding is the online experiment <a href="http://lab.intransitione.com/mobile-icons-generator">Mobile Icons Generator</a>. This tool takes as input as many images as you want and creates a set of icons usable on an Android or iOS device. 

I didn't write it only for educational purposes, I wrote it because I really need such a tool. Although it's easy to setup a script to resize images using <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> having a web interface is more practical when there are lot of options.

Now I'm back coding in Javascript...
