I finally got an invitation from <a href="http://plus.google.com">Google Plus</a>. <a href="http://kassoulet.blogspot.com/">Thanks</a>.

<h3>What I like about G+</h3>

<ul>
        <li><strong>Circles</strong>. It is what I was missing the most from Facebook. Finally I can share something only with my closest friends. I fail to understand why in Facebook you can create group of friends but you can't limit what you post only to these groups.</li>
	<li><strong>No spam</strong> applications like <em>"X answered a question about you"</em>, <em>"*.ville"</em>, <em>"see who checked your profile, 110% guaranteed."</em> like in Facebook.</li>
	<li>Integrate with <strong>Picasa</strong>, I'll start to use Picasa Web Albums soon. I don't like to upload pictures on Facebook because the day I want to get rid of my account I'll also have to say goodbye to my pictures as there's no easy way to migrate them or make them available to the public without having a FB account.</li>
	<li>I use the <strong>Following</strong> circle as a Twitter alternative. I can follow technical posts from other geeks without the information overload I get from Twitter.</li>
	<li><strong>Hangout</strong>. I confess I haven't tried it yet but the possibility to video chat with multiple people is what I wanted in Skype and that currently I don't have (in the free version).</li>
        <li><strong>One click away</strong>. I've always a Gmail or a Reader window open and I can see the notifications in the G+ account with the toolbar positioned at the top of the page. </li>
        <li>The <strong>+1's</strong> column. I like to be able to see everything I +1ed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I dislike about G+</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Chat.</strong> People from GChat is added automatically, including the ones that I chose to never be shown in the list. This completely bypass the privacy system offered by Circles. People that I don't even classify as acquaintances appear in the list even if I explicitly selected "Never Shown" in GChat from GMail. This is annoying. Also I feel too much having GChat AND Huddle. They should just offer one with the option to have live audio and/or video, like with Skype.</li>
        <li>Can't <strong>tag</strong> people in <strong>videos</strong> ? I may be wrong but if there isn't a section <em>"Videos of you"</em> I guess it's not possible.</li>
        <li>No integration with <strong>GMail</strong>. When I see the profile of a contact I would like to see the e-mails I sent to him/her.</li>
        <li><strong>Sparks</strong>. Wouldn't it be better to integrate feeds from Reader instead of showing random news about a topic ? And it currently works pretty bad, I typed "Android Programming" as interest and I didn't get a link that was talking about that. First result was: <em>"Report: Mobile malware to affect more than 1 in 20 devices within 12 to 24 ..."</em>, second <em>"MatD's homepage - Panini Album FIFA Women's World Cup 2011 :: Android ...".</em> D'oh!.
</ul>

<h3>What I would like in G+ that is currently not available</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Skype-like functionalities</strong>. I want a "phone number" as with Skype and I want to be able to share it with the Circles I want. This can be extended to include real calls to mobile phones and landlines.</li>
	<li><strong>An official API</strong> to add new functionalities. Much of the success of Facebook comes from the zillions of applications available. Although I don't like 99% of the applications of Facebook, there's still 1% that I found useful.</li>
        <li><strong>Youtube integration.</strong> I want the option to show the videos I've on Youtube, including the comments.</li>
        <li>A <strong>Facebook photos/videos importer.</strong></li>
        <li>I would like to receive a <strong>notification</strong> that I've received a <strong>new e-mail</strong> in the toolbar so I can leave open only the tab with G+.</li>
</ul>

Conclusion, <strong>I like Google Plus</strong>. 

I'll keep using it and as soon as my best friends will move to G+ I'll get rid of Facebook and Twitter. Not immediately though, at least for Facebook. I've never been a fan of Twitter so I'll get rid of my account very quickly. It would be nice though if along with the +1 button to put on a website Google would offer a functionality to share a link similar to the one offered by Twitter.

I guess it's still too early to get rid of Skype but then I don't want either to get too much dependent on Google. <a href="http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2009/04/google_quietly.php"><em>"Don't be evil"</em></a> was a thing of the past.
