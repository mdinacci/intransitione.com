      <p>I've been using (and still do !) several controls from <a href="http://cocoacontrols.com"/>cocoacontrols.com</a> and from <a href="http://cocoapods.org"/>CocoaPods</a>. It's great to see so many high quality components freely available, I can't calculate how many hours I've saved by using them...</p>

<p>I've been using (and still do !) several controls from <a href="http://cocoacontrols.com"/>cocoacontrols.com</a> and from <a href="http://cocoapods.org"/>CocoaPods</a>. It's great to see so many high quality components freely available, I can't calculate how many hours I've saved by using them.</p>

<p>I'm happy to finally contribute to these projects by releasing a simple custom <i>UIView</i> that can be used to represent progress in discrete steps. The inspiration comes from <a href="http://www.lumosity.com">lumosity</a>, whose iOS app uses a very similar component to represent the steps done in a game session. I'm quite convinced though not 100% sure that they're using an image instead of a customisable component.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://github.com/mdinacci/MDRadialProgress"/>github project</a> comes with an example (see <code class="simple">ViewController.m</code>) and documentation. 
You can install it by copying the <code class="simple">MDRadialProgressView.{m|h}</code> into your project or by using Cocoapod by adding this line <code class="simple">pod 'MDRadialProgress', '~> 0.1.1' </code> to your project's Podfile.</p>

<br>

<p>The simplest way to use it is to leave all properties with their default value and just customise <code class="simple">progressTotal</code> and <code class="simple">progressCompleted</code>:</p>

<p style="margin-top:20px">
{% highlight objc %}

// Create an instance of the view with a width and height (and consequently a diameter) of 50px. 
CGRect frame = CGRectMake(30, 30, 50, 50);
MDRadialProgressView *radialView = [[MDRadialProgressView alloc] initWithFrame:frame];

// Total number of steps    
radialView.progressTotal = 5;
// Number of steps completed
radialView.progressCurrent = 2;

// Customise colours and thickness here...see documentation on github

// Add to existing view
[self.view addSubview:radialView];

{% endhighlight %}
