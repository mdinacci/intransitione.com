<p>In this guide I'll go through all the steps required to port your Java Swing application to OpenJDK with the goal of preparing it for the submission into the App Store.
Although the App Store guidelines explicitly forbids applications to rely on deprecated or optionally installed technologies (Apple no longer bundles their JDK port so applications can't rely on the user to have it installed), you can still distribute your Java application on the App Store by embedding the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK 7 OSX port</a> in a native OSX application.
</p>

<div align="center"><img src="/img/java_app_store.png" border="0"/></div>

<p></p>

<p>It may sounds obvious but the procedure that follows can be performed only on OSX, not from Windows, Linux or any other OS.</p>

Follow this steps:

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<h4>OpenJDK</h4>
<p>First of all, you need to acquire the OpenJDK OSX port. There are 3(½) ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li> Download the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle binary distribution</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/macosx-port/">Clone the Mercurial repository</a>. Compile it with Java 6 or 7 if you already have it. Pick OpenJDK7u to get the stability of OpenJDK7 and the backwards updates from OpenJDK 8.</li>
    <li>Download one of the excellent Henry Gomez's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/openjdk-osx-build/">pre-built packages</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Don't know which one to choose ?</strong></p>
<p>Getting the source should be the only reasonable option if you're serious about bringing your application to the App Store. However if you want to get started quickly and are not interested in the bleeding edge version, download the Oracle distribution. If you want the latest version of the code but don't want to build it yourself, download one of the Henry Gomez's pre-built images.</p>
<p>Note that the Oracle bundle and the OpenJDK have different licences, the first is released under the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/index.html">Binary Code License</a> agreement , the second under the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html">GPL version 2 with Classpath Exception</a>. Make your choice.</p>

<p class="headsup">(½) <b>The absolute best setup</b> would be to clone the official repo and then replace the <em>jdk</em> subrepo with <a href="http://infinitekind.com">our</a> <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sreilly/openjdk7u-jdk">stable</a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mdinacci/openjdk7u-jdk">my slightly more experimental</a> fork. At the time of writing the stable and experimental forks are the same but they may diverge in the future.</p>

<p>If you want to know more of what's included in the fork you may find useful reading my other article <a href="http://intransitione.com/blog/forking-jdk-for-fun-and-profit">forking the JDK for fun and profit.</a></p>

<h4>AppBundler</h4>
<p>Once you have finished downloading the OpenJDK you need to install <strong>AppBundler</strong> to package your application.</p>

<p><a href="http://java.net/projects/appbundler" title="Download AppBundler">AppBundler</a> is an ant task so just put the downloaded jar in the <em>lib</em> folder in your ant distribution and then <a href="http://java.net/projects/appbundler/pages/Home" title="AppBundler instructions">follow the instructions</a> to package your application. It still misses a few features like the ability to register your application with a particular file type but it allows to include a Java runtime within the application bundle and building an <strong>Info.plist</strong> file with most of the required keys.</p>

<p class="headsup">At one point, you'll feel the AppBundler will miss some of features you need. Luckily for you, we have again a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sreilly/appbundler">stable</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mdinacci/appbundler">a slightly more experimental</a> fork that add plenty more features. If you're interested <a href="http://intransitione.com/blog/forking-jdk-for-fun-and-profit">you can read more</a> about what's included in this fork.</p>

<p>Note that some keys are compulsory and your application won't be accepted if they're missing so be sure they're present. You must declare at least:</p>

<ul>
    <li>CFBundleIdentifier</li>
    <li>CFBundleVersion</li>
    <li>NSHumanReadableCopyright</li>
    <li>LSApplicationCategoryType</li>
</ul>

<p>Refer to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPRuntimeConfig/Articles/ConfigFiles.html" title="Apple Documentation">Apple documentation</a> for the meaning of these keys or just follow this example to be sure they're always included:</p>

<h3>Make your application sandbox proof</h3>

<p>Starting from the 1st of June all applications submitted to the App Store must be sandbox ready.</p> 
<p>For a comprehensive explanation of what the sandbox is refers to the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html">Apple documentation</a>.
In short though, the sandbox is an access control mechanism which restricts interaction of your application with the operating system.</p>

<p>The <em>container</em> is the directory where your application can safely read/write the files required for its correct functioning. It is physically located in <strong><em>~/Library/Containers/yourapp.bundle.id</em></strong>; I doubt this is likely to change anytime soon so if you have a very simple application you <b>may</b> hardcode this path instead of relying on a native library to return it for you. I say may because I can't possibly know how Apple will react if you hardcode the path of the container instead of obtaining it by using the API.</p>

<p>If your application will require storing user documents in the container or writing temporary files and you don't want to risk any surprise you'll have to build a native extension to get the appropriate directories. A JNI wrapper is the easiest route, the only problem I encountered is that <strong>javah</strong> generate headers files with the line: 

{% highlight c %}
#include <jni.h>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>which I had to change to </p>

{% highlight c %}
#include <JavaVM/jni.h>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Here's a simple Makefile to generate the headers and fix this include line:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/sh

DIST = jni_headers
CP = foobaz.jar
CLASS = com.foobaz.yourclass

all:
    mkdir -p $(DIST)
    javah -jni -d $(DIST) -cp $(CP) $(CLASS)
    sed -i ""  's/jni.h/JavaVM\/jni.h/' $(DIST)/*.h

clean:
    rm *.o *.class
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now that you have your C header you can create a function that will return for example the <em>Application Support</em> folder for your application, which is located inside the appplication container:</p>

{% highlight c %}
JNIEXPORT jstring JNICALL 
Java_com_foobar_OSXAdapter_getApplicationSupportFolder
(JNIEnv *env, jobject jthis) {
    jstring path;
    
    @autoreleasepool {
        
        JNF_COCOA_ENTER(env);
        
        NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(
                                NSApplicationSupportDirectory, 
                                NSUserDomainMask, YES);
        NSString *basePath = [paths objectAtIndex:0];
        
        // Convert the NSString to a jstring
        const char *cString = [basePath UTF8String];
        path = (*env)->NewStringUTF(env, cString);
        
        JNF_COCOA_EXIT(env);
    }
    
    return path;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p></p>

<h3>Migrate existing application data and preferences</h3>

<p>If you're not releasing a new application chances is that you are already saving your application data and preferences somewhere, most likely in <em>~/Library/Application Support/YourApp</em>.</p>

<p>Once your updated application is executed in the sandbox, that folder will be inaccessible for your program, but luckily Apple thought of a migration mechanism, which happens automatically the first time the user start the application. Here's an example of how you would migrate the preferences in <em>~/Library/Application Support/YourApp</em> to <em>~/Library/Container/com.yourcompany.YourApp/Data/Library/Application Support/YourApp</em>.</p>

<a name="#stepfour"></a>
<h3>Build and sign the application bundle</h3>
<p>This is where you need to have a Mac developer account. You could technically sign your bundle with a test key but you won't be able to submit your app nor to install it.</p>

<p>The process is made of three steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Write an entitlements file to specify the permissions your application requires.</li>
    <li>Sign the bundle.</li>
    <li>Package it.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first step require writing a <em>plist</em> file listing the permissions you need. Head over to the Apple website and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/EntitlementKeyReference/EnablingAppSandbox/EnablingAppSandbox.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011195-CH4-SW1">check the documentation</a> to find out which keys are available. </p>

<p>I'll show a simple example and I'll later demonstrate how to include it in your bundle:</p>

{% highlight xml %}
?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <!-- Activates the sandbox, required. -->
    <key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
    <true/>
    <!-- Allow your application read/write access to the user downloads folder -->
    <key>com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-write</key>
    <true/>
    <!-- Allow your application read/write access to the file selected by the user. -->
    <key>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write</key>
    <true/>
    <!-- Allow your application to initiate network requests -->
    <key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
    <true/>
    <!-- Allow your application to listen for network requests -->
    <key>com.apple.security.network.server</key>
    <true/>
    <!-- Allow your application to use the printer -->
    <key>com.apple.security.print</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>It's not very difficult to understand what's going on in the above example, especially with the comments, but <em>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write</em> deserves a more detailed explanation. The user selected file corresponds to the selected file or directory in a file dialog (either open or save). Note that on OSX this means that <b>you're obliged to use the <em>FileDialog</em> instead of the <em>JFileChooser</em></b>, this is because the former uses the native <em>NSOpenDialog</em> and <em>NSSaveDialog</em> which are compatible with the sandbox.</p>

<p>Now let's see how to sign your bundle (that you have generated using AppBundler):</p>
<p>I assume that you have downloaded and installed the two keys required for signing the bundle from the Apple developer website. Of course you need to be registered as a Mac developer.</p>

<p>First, you have to sign the application bundle, which you do by executing the following command from a terminal: </p>
{% highlight bash %}
codesign -v -f -s SIGNING_ID_APP --entitlements YourApp.entitlements YourApp.app
{% endhighlight %}

<p>SIGNING_ID_APP is the name of your key which is named something like <b>3rt Party Mac Developer Application: <em>your name here</em></b></p>

<p>Second, you need to sign every jar and dylib (the jvm obiously have plenty) contained in the bundle:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
find YourApp.app/Contents/ -type f \( -name "*.jar" -or -name "*.dylib" \) -exec codesign --verbose -f -s SIGNING_ID_APP --entitlements YourApp.entitlements {} \;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>It doesn't harm to verify that the signing process went well:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
echo "Verify all libraries have been signed..."
find YourApp.app/Contents/ -type f \( -name "*.jar" -or -name "*.dylib" \) -exec codesign --verbose --verify {} \;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Finally you can create a <em>.pkg</em> ready for submission:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
productbuild --component YourApp.app /Applications --sign SIGNING_ID_INSTALLER YourApp.pkg
{% endhighlight %}

<p>SIGNING_ID_APP is the name of your <em>installer</em> key which is named something like <b>3rt Party Mac Developer Installer: <em>your name here</em></b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:25px">Congratulations, your app is ready for submission! </p>

<h2>Known problems</h2>

<p>Plenty unfortunately, however I fixed most of the ones I've encountered and included the fixes in our forks. The easiest way to get them is to clone our <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sreilly/openjdk7u-jdk">jdk</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sreilly/openjdk7u-jdk">AppBundler</a> stable forks. Or the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mdinacci/openjdk7u-jdk">experimental jdk</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mdinacci/openjdk7u-jdk">AppBundler</a> if you like.</p>

<p>Here's a list of most of the problems I've encountered and their solution, where available:</p>

<h4>Launch failure <em>(LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error...)</em></h4>

    <p><a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/macosx-port-dev/2012-May/004116.html"/>Mailing list Discussion</a>. 
    <p>This is not a bug in the AppBundler but it is related to <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7159381">this bug</a> which should be fixed soon.</p>

<h4>libfreetype absolute reference causes applications inside a sandbox to crash</h4>
    <p><a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/macosx-port-dev/2012-May/004187.html" title="ML discussion">Mailing list discussion</a></p>

    <p>All Swing/AWT apps won't even open because they rely on the freetype lib installed on the user system but the sandbox will immediately block your application the access to it and your application will crash.</p>

    <p>The proper solution would be to fix the OpenJDK makefiles otherwise a quick workaround is to use two nifty tools called <b>otool</b> and <b>install_name_tools</b>:

    <p>First, find out where <em>libfontmanager.dylib</em>,located in the lib directory of your VM, expects to find freetype.</p>

    <p>Open a shell and type:</p>

    {% highlight bash %}
    $ otool -L libfontmanager.dylib
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p>Take note of the libfreetype path, likely <em>/usr/X11/libfreetype.6.dylib</em> unless you have built freetype yourself and installed it somewhere else. Now type:</p>

    {% highlight bash %}
    $ sudo install_name_tool -change /usr/X11/libfreetype.6.dylib @rpath/libfreetype.dylib libfontmanager.dylib
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p>Type again <em>otool -L libfontmanager.dylib</em> and you should see the change.
    We have changed the path to where libfontmanager look for libfreetype to a relative one. So now you have to copy the system or your custom-build freetype library inside the JVM in the same location as libfontmanager.dylib. <br />Relaunch your application, you should at least be able to see it now :)</p>
</li>

<h4><em>segmentedTextured</em> buttons not working</h4>
    <p><a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/macosx-port-dev/2012-May/004073.html" title="ML discussion">Mailing list Discussion.</a></p>
    <p>I didn't find a solution for this, but it seems that increasing the margin around the button make the problem go away. I couldn't afford to have too much empty space though so I just replaced the decorations with an image.</p>

<h4>OpenJDK Universal build not available</h4>
    <a href="http://openjdk-osx-build.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/patches-jdk7u-osx/universal-build.patch">Patch by Henry Gomez</a>. A slightly different one has been applied in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sreilly/openjdk7u-jdk">our jdk fork</a>.

<h4>AppBundler universal binary</h4>
    <p>There's no point to have a 32/64 OpenJDK if your JavaAppLauncher only supports a 64bit architecture. Again, head over to our BitBuckets repos to get the fix.</p>

<h4>Dock Icon defaults to Generic Java Application</h4>
    <p class="success"><b>UPDATE:</b> I believe this has been fixed too but I haven't found the reference yet.</p>

    <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7159381">Dock Icon defaults to Generic Java Application</a>
    <p>The (temporary) solution here is to specify both <em>CFBundleIconFile</em> and <em>-Xdock:icon=Contents/Resources/your-icon</em> in your <em>Info.plist</em> file. This could be done easily with AppBundler, I've written an example above.</p>

<h4><em>apple.awt.fileDialogForDirectories</em> property not working.</h4>
    <p class="success"><b>UPDATE:</b> this patch has been accepted, it's already in OpenJDK 8 and will be soon in OpenJDK 7u</p>

    <p><a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7161437">Bug report</a>, 
    <a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/macosx-port-dev/2012-May/004295.html">discussion</a> and <a href="http://intransitione.com/code/7161437.patch">a standalone patch</a>.</p>

<h4>JFileChooser broken in the sandbox.</h4>
    <p><a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7172752">Bug report</a>.
    <a href="http://">Discussion</a>. There is no workaround for this, except to switch to a <em>FileDialog</em>
    .The bug has been incorrectly closed as duplicate of another issue with <em>Runtime.exec()</em>.</p>

<h4>Crash when opening an application from a registered file</h4>
    <p class="success"><b>UPDATE:</b> my patch has been integrated into OpenJDK 8 and backported to OpenJDK 7u.</p>
<a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7170716" title="Bug">Bug report</a> and <a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/macosx-port-dev/2012-May/004226.html" title="Discussion">Discussion</a>.
    <p>If a user double click on a file to open your application the application will crash before even showing its main window.

<h4><em>awt.brush.metalLook</em> is not observed.</h4>
    <p class="success">This has been fixed, see <a href="http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~serb/7124513/webrev.01/">webrev</a>.</p>
    <p><del><a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/macosx-port-dev/2012-May/004227.html">Planned to be fixed in jdk7u6</a></del>.</p>

<h4>Sandbox Violation on Runtime Exec</h4>
    <p><a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7175692">Bug description</a> and <a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/macosx-port-dev/2012-June/004375.html">ML discussion</a>. Because of the sandbox an application can't create a child process; there are a few workarounds but they all involve writing native code. The real solution is to use <em>posix_spawn</em>.</p>

<h4>Private API usage</h4>
    <p>Our first app submission failed because some awt files use some functions defined in some Apple private frameworks. I replaced the functions I've found with public API and added a patch to the bug report.</p>
    <p><a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7187834">Bug report</a> and <a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/macosx-port-dev/2012-July/004664.html">ml discussion</a>.</p>
