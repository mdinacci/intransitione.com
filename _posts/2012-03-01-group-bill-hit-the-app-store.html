<p>After having worked for four months at a reasonably big native iOS application and not seeing it yet on the store because of a client I'm not too happy with, I finally had my first one being accepted today. </p>
<p>I read nightmare stories about app submissions but I have to say it's been quite easy in my opinion and the review process last less than a week (actually the review itself was done in one day), so I'm very happy with it.</p>

<p><strong>Group Bill</strong> is a simple app to split the restaurant bill, there are already millions available that perform the same task but mine does it with a twist as it uses a trivial but effective formula devised by a british mathematician called Matt Parker.</p>

<p>He explains the details much better than I ever could in this video on Youtube:<p>

<p>I'll update it to French and Spanish and then I'll be ready to start a bigger project.
