<p>I just released my first Android application <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.marcodinacci.android.movierec">on the Android market</a>. Technically it's the second but it's the first one on the market.</p>

<p><strong>Movie Suggestions</strong> is a simple application that uses a couple of web services to find a list of movies that you may like.

Once you select a movie you can then read some comments from reviewers and see the trailer on Youtube, where available.</p> 

<p>Graphics and functionalities are pretty basic at the moment but hopefully the only one thing it does it does it well. In any case, I made it to learn the Android framework and it's been a great exercise.</p>

<p>I used the <a href="http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/">Rottentomatoes API</a> to search and retrieve movie informations and another web service to look for the trailer on Youtube. This last one actually saved me a lot of work.</p>

<p>The application is free and will always be but I'm not yet releasing the source code as it uses some libraries I've written that I don't want to release. I will definitely release the wrapper around the Rottentomatoes API as soon as I'll find the time.</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="https://github.com/mdinacci/rottentomatoes-for-android" title="source code">here</a> is the source code of the RottenTomatoes API wrapper. It's not a full wrapper but it covers most of the API.</p>
