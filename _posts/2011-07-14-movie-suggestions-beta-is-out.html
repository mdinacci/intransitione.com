My first Android application <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.marcodinacci.android.movierec">is out on the market</a>. Technically it's the second but the first I didn't release it and I don't have intention to.

<a href="http://www.intransitione.com/blog/movie-suggestions-beta-is-out/screenshot1/" rel="attachment wp-att-1394"><img src="http://www.intransitione.com/intransitione.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/screenshot1-168x300.png" alt="Movie Suggestions screenshot" title="Movie Suggestions screenshot" width="168" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1394" /></a><strong>Movie Suggestions</strong> is a simple application that uses a couple of web services to find a movie you like and to return a list of movies related to your query. Once you select a movie you can then read some comments from reviewers and see the trailer on Youtube, where available. Graphics and functionalities are pretty basic at the moment but hopefully the only one thing it does it does it well. In any case, I do realize that it's not the most useful application in the market, I made it to learn the Android framework not to become rich and famous.

I used the <a href="http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/">Rottentomatoes API</a> to search and retrieve movie informations and another web service I can't remember the name now that look for the correct trailer on Youtube. This last one actually saved me a lot of work.

The application is free and will always be but I'm not yet releasing the source code as it uses some libraries I've written that I don't want to release. I will definitely release the wrapper around the Rottentomatoes API as soon as I'll find the time.

UPDATE: <a href="https://github.com/mdinacci/rottentomatoes-for-android" title="source code">here</a> is the source code of the RottenTomatoes API wrapper. It's not a full wrapper but it covers most of the API.
