<p>A new blog, again. This is probably the fourth time I rewrite this blog but this time I completely changed the technologies. I ditched Wordpress in favor of a static site generated using <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com" title="Jekyll website">Jekyll</a>. I was tired of the slow loading and bloated pages generated by Wordpress because of all the plugins I was using. With Jekyll I have all the control I want on the output of my site, which is what I longed for.</p>

<p>I'm also slowly migrating the post to use HTML5 tags when possible and the stylesheets are written in <a href="http://www.lesscss.org">Less</a> and compiled to CSS. The website should be also resize gracefully when viewed from a mobile device (at least it does from my iPhone...)</p> 
<p>The current design is also temporary, I want to have a better menu and a better homepage and especially a special place for my projects</p>

<p>I'm slowly re-importing the comments on the new system, <a href="http://www.disqus.com">disqus</a>, which could be temporary too as I don't like the fact that is not Open Source, although it's very easy to export all comments from the system so I guess for the moment I'll live with it.</p>

<p>Photos will take ages to import, but I really would like to do it so it will happen before the end of 2012 hopefully. Same goes for my travel articles, I want to have them on the web but they don't fit really in a geek site like the one I have now. Hopefully I'll manage to create a new section and reimport articles and comments.</p>
