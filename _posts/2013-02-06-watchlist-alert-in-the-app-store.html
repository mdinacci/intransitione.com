      <p>My first app on the sale in the Mac App Store is a simple utility app to monitor one's eBay watchlist...</p>

<img src="/img/wa_blog.png" style="border:0px;float:left;margin-right:15px;margin-bottom:15px"/><p>I developed a simple utility application called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/watchlist-alert/id595336765?mt=12">Watchlist Alert</a> which monitors a user's eBay watchlist and notify him when the items in his watchlist are due to expire.</p>

<p>It started as an app to "scratch an itch" as at one point I was using eBay a lot and I was constantly forgetting about the bids I was watching. With a little bit more effort I polished and published it in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/watchlist-alert/id595336765?mt=12">Mac App Store</a>.</p>
<p>I'm planning to distribute it outside the Apple store too, mostly to see how complicated the whole process it.</p>
